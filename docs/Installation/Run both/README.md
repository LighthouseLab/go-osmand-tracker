# Running both the back-end and the front-end.

To run the back-end and the front-end simultaneously, you could either use Docker with docker-compose, two separate Docker containers, or run them without Docker.

Your options for running both the back-end and front-end comes down to this:

- [Run both as one single package with docker-compose.](./With-Docker-Compose.md)

- [Run both separately with Docker.](./With-Docker.md)

- Run both separately without Docker.

- [Instructions for the front-end.](../Run front-end only/Without-Docker.md)
